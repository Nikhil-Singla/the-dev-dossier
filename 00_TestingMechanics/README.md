# 00_TestingMechanics

A dedicated space for **building**, **testing**, and **experimenting** with diverse Python projects; ranging from **machine learning pipelines** to **automation scripts** and **game prototypes**.

## Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Chrome Automation  
Uses **Selenium** to automate batch submission of test cases to an online compiler, extracting both program output and error logs for local storage and validation.

### ðŸ”¹ Dataset Parsing  
Implements a scalable **end-to-end NLP pipeline** for social media datasets, including **data cleaning**, **lemmatization**, **TF-IDF vectorization**, and **multi-model classification** with detailed performance metrics.

### ðŸ”¹ Autobattler
Prototype of an **auto-battler** built with **Pygame**: Currently implements **troop selection**, **stat tracking**, and **basic combat resolution**, for testing basic gameplay features.
