# 00_TestingMechanics

A dedicated space for **building**, **testing**, and **experimenting** with diverse Python projects; ranging from **machine learning pipelines** to **automation scripts** and **game prototypes**.

## Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Chrome Automation  
Uses **Selenium** to automate batch submission of test cases to an online compiler, extracting both program output and error logs for local storage and validation (Used in class assignment to automate the error checking process).

### ðŸ”¹ Dataset Parsing  
Implements a scalable **end-to-end NLP pipeline** for social media datasets, including **data cleaning**, **lemmatization**, **TF-IDF vectorization**, and **multi-model classification** with detailed performance metrics. (Used to extract data for training a model)

### ðŸ”¹ Autobattler
Prototype of an **auto-battler** built with **Pygame**: Currently implements **troop selection**, **stat tracking**, and **basic combat resolution**, for testing basic gameplay features. (Used to test out auto battler events in gameplay)

### ðŸ”¹ Image Processing
Line extracter needed an image processing code, hence testing out functionality for image reduction and line segment detection using Canny Edge Detector algoruthm

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Code are exploratory in nature, focusing on **mechanics testing** rather than production-level polish.
