# My Computer Science Projects
education over the years.

## Projects
- Project 1: Particle System (Interactive particle simulator)
    This code is written in Python using the Pygame library. </br>
    The simulator allows users to simulate the behavior of particles in a virtual environment with various forces, including gravity and repulsion. The program also allows users to push particles away from the mouse cursor and visualize the particles on the screen. The simulator includes several configurable parameters such as screen dimensions, particle capacity, and colors.

- Project 2: Pong
    This code implements the classic game Pong using the turtle module in Python. </br>
    The game includes two paddles, a ball, and a score counter. The ball's speed increases over time, and the game can be exited by pressing the escape key. A function is defined to increase the ball's speed as the game progresses. The code also includes commented out code that could be used to implement a "shoot" functionality.

- Project 3: PHPClicker Game
    This code consists of a clicker game made using HTML/CSS/JS and PHP.
    This game lets a player save their progress to the webserver and then load it from anywhere after creating an account. Currently the PHP database is hosted locally for testing purposes and prevention of malicious attacks, but can be easily adjusted to work on any database by altering the Connect.php file.

- Project 4: Pacman
    This code is written in Python using the Pygame library. </br>
