This is how it appears when I write the notes in one go in the first run.

Now I will write the notes after giving proper space. It should appear in the text file

Now this is after I pressed ctrl+enter to already append the notes. If done properly, there should be a para gap between the two sets of notes.

This is my second attempt for the first run.

Now I have closed and reopened the file.

There should still be only a para of gap as this is my first attempt of the second  running programme


This is teesting my note taker app

Next line stuff
