# Completed Projects

This folder hosts completed or MVP-level projects that I have done for fun, solo. When a project grows enough to warrant its own dedicated repository, it is moved out and the table below is updated to point to the external repo.

<span style="color:red;"> Update process </span>:
- A new row is created when a project has a working MVP.
- When a project is developed enough to benefit from a standalone repo, it is shifted and the GitHub URL is added.
